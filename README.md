<h2>About</h2>
The goal of this project is to produce an application that automatically searches Ebay for a large number of items, pairs it with recent sales history, and determines if there are underpriced items currently on the market.
This will be done leveraging the Ebay Developer API and will initially be written in PHP. If successful, there is scope for an Android app to give alerts when new products are found.
